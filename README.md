# csv-ue4-plugin
A plugin to store runtime parameters to a csv file in UE4 project's `csv_store` folder.
An example Blueprint is included as means of documenting the use of the plugin.
Beware, this is a WIP and therefore the use of this in production is discouraged!

Support for UE 4.21 is only provided at the moment. The plugin is easy to modify for earlier versions.
